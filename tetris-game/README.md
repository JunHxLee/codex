# React Tetris

This project is a simple Tetris game built with React and Vite.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use the arrow keys to control the pieces. Lines are cleared automatically and the score increases by 100 for each cleared line.
